### How to add new Plugins:
example with "Name" as plugin name:
- create a Name.py file that contains an object "plugininfo" of type "PluginInfo" (see helper.py) and a "run" funtion
- Set a friendly name (i.e. "my Plugin") and an dict[str: str] of category indices and names (if applicable, else leave empty)
- populate the run-function with code that logs into your platform and publishes the Event
- add the plugin to the "plugins" array in main ((currently) at line 114)
