### How to add new Plugins:
example with "Name" as plugin name:
- create a Name.py file that contains an object `plugininfo` of type `PluginInfo` (see helper.py) and a `run` funtion
- Set a `str` with a friendly name (i.e. "my Plugin"), a `str` of your default kategory key (if applicable, else `None`) and a `dict[str: str]` of category indices and names (if applicable, else a empty `dict`)
- populate the `run`-function with code that logs into your platform and publishes the Event
- import `Name` and add `Name` to the `plugins` array in main.py ((currently) at line 18)
